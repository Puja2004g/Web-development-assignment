            <h2>About Exception Handling</h2>
            <p>
                Exception handling is a fundamental aspect of Java programming that allows you to gracefully manage and
                recover from runtime errors, also known as exceptions. Exceptions are unexpected or erroneous conditions
                that can occur during program execution. Java provides a robust mechanism for handling exceptions to
                prevent
                program crashes and improve error reporting
            </p>
            <h2>Understanding Exceptions</h2>
            <p>
                Exceptions represent abnormal conditions that occur during the execution of a Java program. These
                conditions
                can be caused by factors like user input, file I/O, network issues, and coding errors.
            </p>

                <h2>Exception Hierarchy</h2>
                <p>
                    Java has a rich hierarchy of exception classes. It is divided into two main categories:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Checked Exceptions</li>
                    <p>
                        These are exceptions that must be explicitly handled by the programmer. They are usually related
                        to
                        external factors such as I/O operations and network communication. Examples include IOException
                        and
                        SQLException.
                    </p>
                    <li>Unchecked Exceptions</li>
                    <p>
                        These exceptions do not require explicit handling and often result from programming errors.
                        Examples
                        include NullPointerException and ArithmeticException.
                    </p>
            </div>
            </ul>
            <h2>Exception Handling Keywords</h2>
            <p>
                Java provides key statements and constructs for working with exceptions, including:
            </p>
            <div class="hierarchy">
                <ul>
                    <li>try</li>
                    <p>
                        A try block is used to enclose code that may generate exceptions. If an exception occurs within
                        the
                        try
                        block, it can be caught and handled in a catch block.
                    </p>
                    <li>catch</li>
                    <p>
                        A catch block follows a try block and is used to catch and handle specific exceptions. It
                        includes
                        the
                        exception type and code to execute when that exception occurs.
                    </p>
                    <li>finally</li>
                    <p>
                        The finally block, if used, contains code that is executed regardless of whether an exception
                        occurred
                        or not. It's typically used for cleanup and resource release.
                    </p>
                    <li>throw</li>
                    <p>
                        The throw keyword is used to manually throw an exception. This can be useful when you want to
                        create
                        custom exceptions or indicate exceptional conditions in your code.
                    </p>
                    <li>throws</li>
                    <p>
                        The throws keyword is used in method declarations to indicate that the method might throw a
                        particular
                        exception. It's part of the method's contract and informs callers of potential exceptions.
                    </p>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Try-Catch-Finally Construct</h2>
            <p>
                The most common structure for handling exceptions in Java is the try-catch-finally construct. It
                provides
                structured exception handling, ensuring that exceptions are caught and processed, and resources are
                released
                correctly.</p>
            <div class="end">
                <h2>Custom Exceptions</h2>
                <p>
                    Java allows you to create custom exception classes by extending existing exception classes. This is
                    helpful
                    when you want to represent application-specific exceptional conditions.
