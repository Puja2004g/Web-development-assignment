        <h2>About "throws" in Java</h2>
        <p>
            The "throws" keyword in Java is used to declare exceptions that a method can throw. It is used in the method
            signature to indicate that the method may throw one or more specific types of exceptions during its
            execution.
        </p>

        <h2>What is "throws"</h2>
        <p>
            In Java, when a method can potentially encounter exceptions but does not handle them within the method, it
            can
            declare these exceptions using the "throws" keyword. This informs the calling code that it must either
            handle
            these exceptions or declare them again using "throws" in the calling method's signature.
        </p>

        <h2>When is "throws" used</h2>
        <p>
            "throws" is used in various scenarios, including:
        </p>
        <p>Declaring Checked Exceptions: It is used to declare checked exceptions, which are exceptions that are
            checked at compile time. This helps ensure that calling code handles or acknowledges the possibility of
            these exceptions.</p>
        <p>Propagating Exceptions: "throws" allows exceptions to propagate up the call stack, enabling higher-level
            code to handle or report the exceptions as needed.</p>
        <p>Creating Custom Exception Types: Developers can use "throws" to create and use custom exception types
            tailored to their application's needs.</p>
        <p>Multi-Exception Handling: It is useful when a method can throw multiple exceptions of different types,
            and
            the caller needs to handle them or declare them accordingly.</p>

        <h2>Advantages of "throws"</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Clarity: It provides clarity to the caller about the exceptions that need to be handled when using the
                method, enhancing code readability.</li>
            <li>Propagation: "throws" enables exceptions to propagate up the call stack, allowing for centralized error
                handling and logging in higher-level code.</li>
            <li>Forcing Exception Handling: It enforces the obligation to handle exceptions, either by handling them
                within
                the method or declaring them again using "throws" in the calling method's signature, improving code
                reliability.</li>
            <li>Custom Exception Handling: Developers can create and use custom exception types, making it easier to
                manage
                and categorize different types of exceptions in their applications.</li>
            <li>Multiple Exception Handling: "throws" is flexible enough to handle multiple exceptions of different
                types,
                providing a fine-grained approach to exception management.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Syntax of "throws"</h2>
        <p>
            Here is the syntax for using "throws" in a method signature:
        </p>
        <div class="syntax">
            <p>
                public void exampleMethod() throws SomeException, AnotherException <br>{<br>
                    // method implementation 
                    <br>
                }
            </p><br>
        </div>
    </aside>
