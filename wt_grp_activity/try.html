        <h1>Try Block</h1>
        <h2>About Try Block</h2>
        <p>
            A try block is a fundamental part of Java's exception handling mechanism. It is used to enclose a block
            of
            code in which exceptional conditions might occur. The primary purpose of the try block is to provide a
            structured way to handle exceptions and prevent your program from crashing when unexpected runtime
            errors
            occur
        </p>
        <h2>What is a try block</h2>
        <p>
        <p>A try block is a Java programming construct used to enclose a section of code where exceptions may
            be
            thrown.</p>
        <p>It is the starting point for exception handling in Java.</p>
        </p>
        <h2>When is it used</h2>
        <p>
        <p>The try block is used when you have code that might raise exceptions, and you want to handle those
            exceptions gracefully instead of letting them crash the program.</p>
        <p>Common scenarios for using a try block include file operations, network communication, and
            mathematical
            calculations where division by zero or other unexpected errors can occur.</p>
        </p>
        <h2>Advantages of the try block</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Robustness</li>
            <p>
                The primary advantage of a try block is that it makes your code more robust. It prevents your
                program
                from abruptly terminating when an exception is thrown, allowing you to handle errors gracefully
            </p>
            <li>Error Recovery</li>
            <p>
                It provides a structured way to recover from exceptions, such as logging the error, displaying
                user-friendly messages, or taking alternative actions to handle exceptional conditions.
            </p>
            <li>Resource Cleanup</li>
            <p>
                The try block can be used in conjunction with a finally block to ensure that critical resources are
                properly released, even in the presence of exceptions. This is important for maintaining resource
                integrity.
            </p>
            <li>Structured Exception Handling</li>
            <p>
                It allows you to have multiple catch blocks, each handling a specific type of exception. This
                enables
                you to write specialized error-handling code for different exceptional situations.
            </p>
            <li>Improved Debugging</li>
            <p>
                By handling exceptions in a try block, you can log detailed information about the exception, making
                it
                easier to debug and fix issues in your code
