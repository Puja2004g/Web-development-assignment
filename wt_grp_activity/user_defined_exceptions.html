        <h1>User-Defined Exceptions</h1>
            <h2>About User Defined Exceptions</h2>
            <p>
                In Java, you can create your own custom exceptions, known as user-defined exceptions. These exceptions
                extend the standard exception classes and are used to handle specific error conditions in your
                application.
            </p>

            <h2>What are User-Defined Exceptions</h2>
            <p>
                User-defined exceptions are custom exception classes that you create by extending the base exception
                classes
                available in Java, such as <code>Exception</code> or <code>RuntimeException</code>. You can use these
                custom
                exceptions to handle application-specific errors or conditions.
            </p>

            <h2>When to Use User-Defined Exceptions</h2>
            <p>
                User-defined exceptions are used in various scenarios, including:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>Custom Error Handling: They allow you to define and handle application-specific errors or
                    exceptional
                    conditions that are not adequately covered by built-in exceptions.</li>
                <li>Enhanced Readability: By creating custom exceptions, your code becomes more self-explanatory and
                    readable, making it easier to understand and maintain.</li>
                <li>Improved Error Reporting: Custom exceptions provide a structured way to report and handle errors,
                    making
                    it easier to log and trace problems in your application.</li>
                <li>Application-Specific Logic: User-defined exceptions are valuable when your application needs to
                    implement specific error-handling logic based on domain knowledge.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Syntax of User-Defined Exceptions in Java</h2>
            <p>
                Here is the syntax for creating a user-defined exception class in Java:
            </p>
            <div class="syntax">
            <p>
                public class CustomException extends Exception <br>{ <br>
                    // constructor(s) and additional members can be defined
                    <br>
                } <br>
            </p>
        </div>
            <p>
                And here is how you can use your user-defined exception in a method:
            </p>
            <div class="syntax">
            <p>
                public void exampleMethod() throws  CustomException <br>{ <br>
                    // method implementation <br>
                } <br>
            </p> <br>
            </div>
    </aside>
