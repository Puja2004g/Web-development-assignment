        <h1>Catch Blocks </h1>
        <h2>About Catch Block</h2>
        <p>
            A catch block is a fundamental part of Java's exception handling mechanism. It is used to catch and
            handle
            specific exceptions that may occur within a try block
        </p>
        <h2>What is a Catch Block</h2>
        <p>A catch block is a Java programming construct that follows a try block.</p>
        <p>It is used to catch and handle exceptions that are generated within the associated try block.</p>
        <h2>When is it Used</h2>
        <p>A catch block is used when you want to handle specific exceptions that may occur in the code
            enclosed
            within a try block.</p>
        <p>It is used to define how your program should respond when a particular type of exception occurs.
        </p>
        <h2>Advantages of Catch Blocks</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Exception Handling</li>
            <p>
                The primary advantage of a catch block is that it allows you to handle exceptions gracefully. It
                prevents exceptions from propagating up the call stack, which can lead to program crashes.
            </p>
            <li>Specific Handling</li>
            <p>
                Catch blocks are specific to the type of exception they handle. This allows you to provide tailored
                error-handling logic for different types of exceptions. For example, you can handle IOException
                differently from NullPointerException.
            </p>
            <li>Error Reporting</li>
            <p>
                Catch blocks provide a structured way to log or report errors. This is essential for diagnosing and
                debugging issues in your application.
            </p>
            <li>Program Robustness</li>
            <p>
                By using catch blocks, you can make your program more robust and resilient to errors, ensuring that
                it
                continues to operate even when exceptions occur.
            </p>
            <li>Prevent Data Loss</li>
            <p>
                In situations involving file I/O, database operations, or network communication, catch blocks can
                help
                prevent data loss or corruption by handling errors and rolling back transactions if needed.
            </p>
            <li>User-Friendly Messages</li>
            <p>
                Catch blocks allow you to display user-friendly error messages, making it easier for end-users to
                understand and report issues.
            </p>
            <li>Resource Cleanup</li>
            <p>
                In addition to handling exceptions, catch blocks can be used to perform resource cleanup in cases
                where
                resources (e.g., files, database connections) need to be released.
            </p>
        </ol>

        <h2>Syntax of Catch Block</h2>
        <p>
        try{ <br />
            // Code that may generate exceptions <br />
        } <br />
        catch (ExceptionType e) { <br />
            // Code to handle the specific exception (ExceptionType) <br />
        } <br />
    </p>
        <h2>Example</h2>
        <p>
            try {<br />
                int result = 10 / 0; <br />
            }<br />
            catch (ArithmeticException e) { <br />
                System.out.println("An arithmetic exception occurred: " + e); <br />
            }
